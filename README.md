# 🧠 Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) – User-Centered Design & Prototyping

This repository contains my work for the **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** module, where I explored how humans interact with digital systems and how to design intuitive, accessible, and user-centered interfaces.

The module focuses on building meaningful digital experiences through:
- UI/UX principles  
- Interaction design  
- User personas & scenario building  
- Storyboarding  
- Wireframes (Low-Fidelity & High-Fidelity)  
- Usability heuristics (Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Heuristics)  
- AR/VR/MR fundamentals  
- User testing and feedback loops

## 📘 Main Project: **Replate – A Sustainable Food Redistribution Prototype**

As part of this module, my team developed **Replate**, a mobile app prototype designed to address **SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production**.  

The goal of the app is to reduce food waste by connecting individuals, restaurants, and NGOs to redistribute surplus food easily and responsibly.

📁 The full project is located inside the `/Replate/` folder.

## 🧠 What I Learned in This Module

### 🎨 UI/UX & Design Skills
- Human-centered design thinking  
- Building personas, storyboards, and journey scenarios  
- Crafting intuitive layouts and visual hierarchies  
- Applying Jakob Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics  
- Conducting heuristic evaluation & usability analysis  

### 🛠 Tools & Techniques
